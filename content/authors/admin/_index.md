I am currently a Computational Biology and Bioinformatics master student at ETH Zürich. I am interested in applying computational tools to study life sciences. Physics graduate from the University of Barcelona. Last year I was an exchange student at KTH Stockholm and I was awarded a Maria Yzuel fellowship to do my Bachelor Thesis at the Institute of Photonic Sciences. I am also fond of education and scientific outreach. Thus, I co-created the project Fisikids for bringing science to primary school kids.
